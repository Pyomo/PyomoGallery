        "\n",
        "The goal of the maximum flow problem is to find the maximum flow possible in a network from some given source node to a given sink node.  Applications of the max flow problem include finding the maximum flow of orders through a job shop, the maximum flow of water through a storm sewer system, and the maximum flow of product through a product distribution system, among others. Schrijver (2002) note that the maximum flow problem was first formulated in 1954 by T. E. Harris and F. S. Ross as a simplified model of Soviet railway traffic flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "A network is a directed graph, and the arc capacities, or upper bounds, are the only relevant parameters.  A network graph does not have to be symmetric: if an arc (v,w) is in the graph, the reverse arc (w,v) does not have to be in the graph. Further, parallel arcs are not allowed, and self-loops are not allowed. The source and the sink are distinct nodes in the network, but the sink may be unreachable from the source.\n",

There's one particular residential area called \"Home\" that is full of panda loving families and there's a fear that the increased number of people visiting the zoo will overload the public transportation system. It will be especially bad in the evening since the zoo closes about the same time as rush hour, so everyone will be trying to find space on the already crowded buses and subways. As a city planner, you were given a map of routes from the zoo to Home, along with the estimated number of families that could go on each route. Additionally, it was estimated that 16 families from Home will visit each day, and it's your task to figure out if this will overload the public transportation system, and, if it does, how could the system be improved?\n",
