# PyomoGallery
A collection of Pyomo examples

#### For Users

This project supports a collection of Pyomo models and scripting examples.  [See the wiki for the list of examples.](https://github.com/Pyomo/PyomoGallery/wiki)

#### For Contributors

We encourage contributions to the Pyomo Gallery from all Pyomo users and developers.  Each example in the gallery is stored in a separate subdirectory, and a Jupyter notebook is used to describe the example.  Existing examples illustrate the expected level of detail, but feel free to structure your example in a different manner as appropriate.
