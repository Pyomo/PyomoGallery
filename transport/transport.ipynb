    "# The Transport Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the Transport Problem is to select the quantities of an homogeneous good that has several production plants and several punctiform markets as to minimise the transportation costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the default tutorial for the GAMS language, and GAMS equivalent code is inserted as single-dash comments. The original GAMS code needs slighly different ordering of the commands and it's available at http://www.gams.com/mccarl/trnsport.gms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transport Problem can be formulated mathematically as a linear programming problem using the following model.  \n",
