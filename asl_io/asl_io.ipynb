    "# Loading ASL Results into a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scripting example we break apart the work flow that occurs when a Pyomo model is solved using the ASL solver plugin. The ASL solver plugin is a generic interface designed for solvers that utilize the AMPL Solver Library. This library takes model input in the form of an NL file and provides a solver solution in the form of an SOL file. As such, it provides a single unifying framework for interacting with a wide array of optimization solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo includes separate tools for writing NL files and reading SOL files. In this example, we will show how to use these tools directly, as an alternative to calling the ASL solver plugin. In particular, we show how to save information about the symbol map created by the NL writer to a file so that it can be recovered at a later time. The symbol map that is recovered can be used to load a solution from the SOL file reader into any Pyomo model with component names that match those on the model used by the NL writer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving With ASL\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case below where we solve a simple Pyomo model using Ipopt through the ASL solver plugin and then verify that the solver termination condition is optimal before loading the solution into the model. Note that this example assumes Pyomo version 4.1 or later is installed. Since Pyomo 4.1, the **_load_\\__solutions_** keyword must be assigned a value of _False_ when calling the _solve_ method on a solver plugin in order to prevent the solution from being automatically loaded into the model. This allows us to check the solver termination condition before manually loading the solution via the call to _model.solutions.load_\\__from_."

This command requires that the _ipopt_ executable can be found in the shell search PATH and that the code block from the previous section has been executed."
