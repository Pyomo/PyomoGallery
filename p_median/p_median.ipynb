        "\n",
        "The goal of the $p$-median problem is to locating $p$ facilities to minimize the demand weighted average distance between demand nodes and the nearest of the selected facilities. Hakimi (1964, 1965) first considered this problem for the design of network switch centers. \n",
        "However, this problem has been used to model a wide range of applications, such as warehouse location, depot location, school districting and sensor placement.\n",
